                    <p>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned
                        were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I
                        honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</p>

                    <q>I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a
                        transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
                        the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter, The next 12
                        weeks was the best- and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've
                        successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.</q>

                    <q>Before joining the bootcamp, I've
                        never written a line of code, I needed
                        some structure from professionals
                        who can help me learn programming
                        step by step. I was encouraged to
                        enroll by a former student of theirs
                        who can only say wonderful things
                        about the program. The entire
                        curriculum and staff did not
                        disappoint. They were very hands-on
                        and I never had to wait long for
                        assistance. The agile team project, in
                        particular, was outstanding. It took
                        my learning to the next level in a way
                        that no tutorial could ever have, in
                        fact, I've often referred to it during
                        interviews as an example of my
                        developent experience. It certainly
                        helped me land a job as a full-stack
                        developer after receiving multiple
                        offers, 100% recommend!<q>
